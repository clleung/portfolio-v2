            <h3>Existing Knowledge</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Because the Braddock Region Chamber of Commerce (BRCC) was still being formed at the time, without a logo or even a mission statement, we researched chambers of commerce in the region and focused on the goals the BRCC would need to work towards due to their ties with the Braddock Council, Forbes Fund C3 Initiative and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For the initial stages of the project, we incorporated and prioritized the needs of the client: 
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>increasing business and nonprofit opportunities</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>building a network to encopurage mutual support and access</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>reducing the effects of the pandemic on the community</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>developing the youth in the region</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>uplifting the community as a whole</li>
                </ul>

        <div class = "work content"> 
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                To focus on how the BRCC could best serve their community, we looked to various development centers, business associations, and mentorship programs nearby to compare their strengths and weaknesses.  Our main takeaways were learning the bare essentials needed for the chamber of commerce and why the sites have low accessibility and usability. In particular, we encountered many issues with readability but found that actionable headers simplified the process of efficiently finding and learning new information.
                <br>
                <br>
                We determined that the BRCC site would need a minimalist website that was intuitive and accessible to their users.

        <div class = "work content"> 
            <h3>Target Users</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The BRCC wanted to uplift the community and their economy as a whole—youth, older populations, businesses, nonprofits, and people involved with those groups—so we sought to learn about the regions unders the BRCC: Braddock, North Braddock, and East Pittsburgh. We found that the majority of residents would be older BIPOC individuals with high school education, and that the economy had stagnated ensured that we made considerations towards the older population and those who may have not had the opportunities or resources to seek higher education to develop their businesses.

        <h3>Project Definition</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Because the BRCC was still being developed and left our team with a large amount of creative liberties, we were provided with several path to pursue:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>support businesses, entrepreneurs, nonprofits, and associated entities</li>

                <li>connecting businesses and nonprofits for support and access</li>
                <br>
                <li>providing opportunities for youth through development, internships, and jobs </li>
                <br>
                <li>creating mentorship between businesses and nonprofits</li>

          To represent the communities the BRCC would encapsulate and their target users, we created four personas that were more general because we were unable to acquire more details. We focused on these groups due to their relevance to the BRCC’s cause and statistics of the area.
          <br>
          <br>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Due to time constraints, we narrowed our scope significantly; rather than try to create a rigid structure that would need to be scrapped in the future, our team decided to create the site with the following goals in mind:
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>a resource for the community, geared towards the elderly, youth, entrepreneurs, and seasoned  business owners </li>
            <br>
            <li>a website with high usability and strong branding</li>
            <br>
            <li>a robust and adaptable template allowing for easy updating, particularly for the youth component</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          We further divided these goals into specific functionalities in line with the pain points we determined our personas would have:
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>finding new and updated information in the community, such as highlights and workshops</li>
            <br>
            <li>searching for particular businesses and nonprofits in the community</li>
            <br>
            <li>steps for starting a new business</li>
            <br>
            <li>advice and outreach for developing oneself or their business/nonprofit</li>
            <br>
            <li>learning about the BRCC </li>

          With more general functions in mind, we developed a shallow website according to general functions: finding local businesses, starting your own business, growing your own business, about us, and the home page.

        <br>
        <p>
          Since we were all working virtually, we compiled our final sketches in Figma, focusing more on the information the BRCC would be able to produce by the end of the project for deployment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Home</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          We took inspiration from websites we looked at during out competitive analysis, using a carousel to welcome users, simple boxes with the area of interest, and contact details in the footer. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Find Local Businesses</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          We utilized another carousel to go through the highlighted businesses or nonprofits and used a side navigation bar for the industries. We also used a simple image and business-name combination, as we intended for each business to have their own page within the site to provide more information. 
          <br>
          <br>
          We used breadcrumbs and bolded the tabs to indicate the user’s current position within the site.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          We provided a very general mission statement along with information about meeting the board, learning about sponsors, and being able to join the BRCC.

          After our first round of user testing, we found that nesting the “Join Us” button in the About Us page made it impossible to find for users, and that nesting the Meet the BRCC Board page in the About Us page made it difficult to find. We also found issues with hierarchy and spacing that we changed for our next iteration.

          We used a banner at the top to strength the BRCC’s branding, as they are a new organization, and based it off of our wireframes for phones and tablets (middle and right). 
          <br>
          <br>
          Further, we used font weight and size to encourage users to skim through the page.
        </p>
        <h4>Reducing Cognitive Load</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          We used actionable tabs such as “Find”, “Start”, and “Grow” to make it easier for older users and reduce the amount of reading. 
          <br>
          <br>
          On the find page, we used icons to signify the industry and standards that the business/nonprofit would meet, providing more information but not cluttering the page.

        <h3>User Testing</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          After our second round of user testing, we found that we needed to increase the hierarchy for the button to join the BRCC and page titles, but otherwise successfully ensured efficient navigation amongst our users.

        <h3>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          After our two rounds of user testing, we finalized our wireframes to strengthen hierarchy and establish consistency throughout all pages.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Improved Hierarchy</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          We made the “Join Us” button a jumbotron with a short explanation to ensure that its position remains obvious and stationary, as putting it in the carousel previously would obscure it from view.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Consistency</h4>
        <p>
          We ensured that each page had the same image-banner heading, with a side navigation (if needed) to provide more information or to filter out specific elements, such as the Develop page for Financial help.

        <h3>Working Prototype</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          We used Bootstrap to develop our website prototype during the last week of the project, using a monochrome color scheme in yellow as per the client’s request, along with minor changes to font style to contrast the branding.
          <br>
          <br>
          After meeting with the client to discuss our final wireframes, we also added a calendar integration and split the footer into two layers to make room for new social media outlets if needed, along with a key on the Find page to discern the icons. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Minimal Product</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          Due to time constraints, we only implemented the home page and the find page. Instead, we focused on the responsiveness and the Javascript components, such as the sticky navigation bar, and the highlighting of the current tab.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Responsiveness</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          We used a column drop layout for our website, as the grid component of Bootstrap made it look streamlined and consistent.

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            For the project, we were challenged with creating a site for a new organization that we had no familiarity with, and had never worked together before. As the research and project lead, I personally had the challenge of learning how to lead and how to efficiently communicate to meet deliverable deadlines and ensure high quality work. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Working remotely was one of our largest obstales, and given the chance, we would have like to conduct more user testing and work with the client more intensively to develop their online identity.
